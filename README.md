I am a problem solver with 10 years of experience in leading teams, experimentation, data science and analytics. Outside of that, I like outdoor adventures, cooking and reading. 


# Projects
My projects are solutions to real world problems Iâ€™ve faced. Please use and suggest improvements so that we can deliver high quality tools to our fellow data practitioners.

### In Development
- **[Sales Forecasting](https://github.com/tylerfach/stochastic-sales-forecast)**: Stochastic model for forecasting revenue from leads along with diagnostic tools for reporting on actual compared to forecast.

### Backlog
- **[Experimenty]()**: Library for better experimentation analysis and reporting.
- **[Experiment Design]()**: Guided walkthrough for experiment design.
- **[Darn Good Plots]()**: Reference for Matplotlib to make useful and visually elegant plots easy to produce.

## External Resources
*Others repositories and packages I've found helpful*

- **[pymc-marketing](https://github.com/pymc-labs/pymc-marketing):** the successor to the [lifetimes](https://github.com/CamDavidsonPilon/lifetimes/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file) packake that covers the BG/NBD ("Buy till you die") model for customer lifetime value. This is where I would start for a modeling customer lifetime value.
